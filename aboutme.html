				<p class="aboutme">Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal website! As you may already know, my name is Woo (I also go by Will). Here you will my current interests, some of my projects, my resume, and ways to connect with me. Before you leave, I would like to quickly introduce myself:</p>
	
				<p class="aboutme">I was born in Seoul, South Korea and raised in Henrico, Virginia. Since when I was in high school, I was very determined to attend an out-of-state university. I saw college as a new chapter in life. I wanted to write about meeting new people, expanding my network further, and collaborating with diverse-minded individuals towards innovation; thereby becoming leaders of tomorrow. With that being said, it was an easy choice when it came to deciding between an in-state and out-of-state school. Till this day, that was the best decision I've made in my 20 years. I am beyond blessed to call this place my home: Syracuse Univeristy.</p>

				<p class="aboutme">I'm currently a third-year undergraduate student studying Information Management & Technology and Applied Mathematics along with a minor in Economics. Using my analytical, technical, and management skills, I am genuinely interested in working within an intersection of business and technology.</p>

				<p class="aboutme">Something I like to tell myself and others is an analysis that I came up with: The Bus Analysis. In a bus, there are "bus riders" and of course, a "bus driver". While these "bus riders" enter and exit the bus on a frequent basis, the "bus driver" stays in his or her seat and keeps on driving from destination to another destination. I always strive to be the "bus driver" because I identify myself as a leader who is the driving force and heading towards success. Regardless of how many destinations are laid out for me to reach that success, I will always be driving that "bus", my life. I do not want to be the "bus rider" who only shows up for certain things and disappears for the rest. I am all about exceeding my 120% and never giving up. So I ask you today. Are you a "bus driver" or a "bus rider"?</p>

				<p class="aboutme">Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, add me on Facebook, or send me an email! I hope to see you one day!</p>
