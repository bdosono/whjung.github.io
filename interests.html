				<h3>Social Media</h3>
				<p>I am a firm believer in social media. This allows people, companies, and organizations to interact one another, collaborate towards success, and exchange innovative ideas. With that being said, it is important to stay connected with those around you. You never know, you might end up working together in the near future!</p>

			<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
			<p>With two of my studies being Applied Mathematics and Economics, I've been exposed to A LOT of numbers and applied those to business-related concepts. I wish to apply data by using technicques I've learned such as time analysis and statistical forecasting to make recommendations to businesses.</p>

			<h3>Brand Marketing</h3>
			<p>Marketing plays a HUGE role in the business world. Among important marketing factors such as advertising, sales, and public relations, I personally love branding. This is critical because it's essentially the market identity of an individual or a company. One of the responsibilities from my campus involvements heavily focused on improving and promoting the brand of an organization and its events. I know for sure I will never cease doing this because consumers' perspectives and preference will always change. Therefore, I need to focus on re-branding at all times.</p>
